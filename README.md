# React Portfolio

## Description

- I wanted to create a portfolio using react that displays my projects, resume, information about myself, and my contact info.
- I did this project to create a portfolio for potential employers to be able to access and view my work and learn about me.
- The page is easy to navigate, so in turn is easy to get the information a potential employer may want to see. 
- While creating my portfolio, I learned how to make a lot about using React.
